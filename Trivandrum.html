Intricate wood carvings and distinctive patterns constitute a masterpiece of its kinds. Overhanging attics, pillar-lined courtyards and sloping roofs contribute to the exclusive look of the museum.

The two royal thrones; one manufactured of Bohemian crystals, embossed with an emblem of ‘Conch’ on the backrest and the other made of ivory are the prime attractions of the museum. Marble-made idols and sculptures, musical instruments and the alcove used by Swami Thirunal have also been kept in the showcase. An illusion portrait by veteran painter Sveroslav Roerich is another attractive feature here.
            
            Kuthiramalika, which is often called as Puthenmalika Palace Museum remains open for visitors from 8.30 AM to 1.00 PM and 3.00 PM to 5.30 PM. Monday is the day that it seeks rests from all week-long visits. The best time of the year to visit Kuthiramalika is January. Commemorating the famous Swathi Thirunal, a lively music festival is conducted each year between 6 and 12 January.
